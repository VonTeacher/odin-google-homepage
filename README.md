# Project: HTML/CSS

## Assignment
### Easy Version: Build the Google.com homepage

* Don't be a Perfectionist.
* Use Google.
* If frustrated with trying to get buttons or inputs to style as intended, look into the CSS property `-webkit-appearance: none;` or `-moz-apperance` if using Firefox.

1. Start by putting the main elements on the page (logo image, search form), then get them place horizontally.
2. Next, add the navbar across the top, first building the content and then trying to position it.
3. Add the footer, which should be very similar to the top navbar.
4. In general, do as much independently as possible before relying on developer tools or viewing source code.
5. Lastly, push the project got Github.

### Difficult Version (optional): Build the [Google.com search results page](https://www.google.com/search?q=build+this+webpage)

Reuse much of the code from before. Don't worry about links to nowhere, forms that won't submit, or hard-coding the search results. Focust on the placement and order of items on the page.
